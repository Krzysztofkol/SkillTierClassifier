# Skill Proficiency Tier Classification Algorithm
## Introduction
This document outlines an improved heuristic for classifying skill proficiency levels into tiers S, A, B, C, D, and E. The system uses a series of yes/no questions for each tier, allowing for a more nuanced and accurate self-assessment. This method does not rely on quantitative measures but instead focuses on qualitative indicators of skill proficiency.
## How to Use This System
1. Start with the E-tier questions and work your way up through the tiers.
2. Answer each question honestly with a "Yes" or "No".
3. Continue to the next tier only if you've answered "Yes" to ALL questions in the current tier.
4. Your skill tier is the highest one where you can answer "Yes" to ALL questions in that tier and ALL questions in the tiers below it.
5. If you answer "No" to any question in a tier, your proficiency level is likely the tier below.
## Skill Proficiency Tier Descriptions and Questions
### E-tier (Novice)
- You have minimal experience with the skill
- You require significant guidance to complete tasks
- You're still building foundational knowledge
Questions:
1. Do you have basic theoretical knowledge about this skill? (e.g., key terms, fundamental concepts)
2. Can you perform simple, guided tasks related to this skill with assistance?
3. Are you able to understand and follow basic instructions or tutorials for this skill?
### D-tier (Basic)
- You have fundamental knowledge of the skill
- You can perform simple tasks, but may need guidance for complex ones
- You're still learning best practices
Questions:
1. Can you perform simple tasks related to this skill independently, without guidance?
2. Do you understand the basic principles behind the skill well enough to explain them to a beginner?
3. Are you able to recognize common mistakes or pitfalls related to this skill, even if you might still make them yourself?
4. Can you use basic tools or techniques associated with this skill without constant reference to guides?
### C-tier (Competent)
- You have a solid foundation in the skill
- You can complete routine tasks with minimal guidance
- You're aware of common pitfalls and how to avoid them
Questions:
1. Can you complete routine tasks efficiently and with minimal guidance?
2. Are you able to troubleshoot and solve common problems related to this skill?
3. Can you adapt your knowledge to slightly unfamiliar situations within this skill area?
4. Do you understand best practices for this skill and apply them consistently in your work?
5. Are you able to plan and execute small projects or tasks using this skill with minimal supervision?
### B-tier (Proficient)
- You're comfortable with most aspects of the skill
- You can work independently on standard tasks
- You understand the principles behind the skill
Questions:
1. Are you comfortable with most aspects of the skill, including some advanced concepts?
2. Can you work independently on complex tasks or projects related to this skill?
3. Are you able to critically evaluate different approaches or solutions within this skill area?
4. Can you effectively explain complex aspects of this skill to others who are less proficient?
5. Do you regularly seek out new information or techniques to improve your proficiency in this skill?
### A-tier (Advanced)
- You're highly proficient and can handle difficult tasks independently
- You understand nuances and best practices
- You can mentor others in this skill
Questions:
1. Can you handle difficult, multifaceted tasks or projects using this skill with ease?
2. Are you able to innovate and develop new approaches or solutions within this skill area?
3. Can you mentor others effectively, helping them improve their proficiency in this skill?
4. Are you recognized within your immediate professional circle as someone with high expertise in this skill?
5. Can you synthesize information from various sources to gain deeper insights into complex problems related to this skill?
### S-tier (Mastery)
- You're recognized as an expert in this skill
- You can teach and innovate in this area
- You handle complex, novel challenges with ease
Questions:
1. Are you widely recognized as an expert in this skill, possibly beyond your immediate professional circle?
2. Can you push the boundaries of current knowledge or practice in this skill area?
3. Are you able to handle novel, extremely complex challenges that others in the field struggle with?
4. Have you made original contributions to the theory or practice of this skill (e.g., publications, innovations, significant improvements to processes)?
5. Can you accurately predict trends or future developments in this skill area based on your deep understanding?
## Interpretation Guidelines
- Your tier is the highest one where you can answer "Yes" to ALL questions in that tier and ALL questions in the tiers below it.
- If you answer "No" to any question in a tier, your proficiency level is likely the tier below.
- Be honest in your self-assessment. It's normal and expected that most people will not be in the highest tiers for most skills.
- Remember that this is a general assessment. Specific skills may have unique aspects not fully captured here.
- Use this as a tool for self-reflection and setting learning goals, not as a definitive or official ranking of your abilities.
## Applying This Algorithm
When using this algorithm in a practical setting:
1. Clearly define the skill being assessed to ensure accurate self-evaluation.
2. Consider the context of the skill application (e.g., hobby vs. professional setting) when interpreting results.
3. Use the results to identify areas for improvement and set concrete learning goals.
4. Periodically reassess your skill level to track progress over time.
5. Remember that skill development is a continuous process, and there's always room for growth, even at the highest tiers.
By following this improved algorithm, you can gain a more accurate and nuanced understanding of your skill proficiency levels, helping you to focus your learning efforts and track your progress effectively.
